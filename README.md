# ECommerce Model

## Function
this is a model of how a potential ecommerce businesses backend would look, there is no front end and it is seeded information.
## Purpose
This is to give a lens into what it may be like to organize a db with ORM design and be able to interact and view the db
## Code
With this application, you need to have some sort of api client to access the db otherwise you cannot do anything with it, as it is purely backend. With an api client, such as insomnia, you are able to make CRUD requests.
the api routes are as follows;
```
/api/products
/api/categories
/api/tags
```

with these categories, you can look up all the information in the db and see how each piece interacts with the others.
